            <strong>If I disable the plugin what would happen with the short codes?</strong> <br/>
				When you disable the plugin (that's within the plugin but the plugin is activate in WordPress) all
				the short codes will be removed (visually) but not from the database.
				It is recommended to disable the plugin and not deactivate/uninstall it when you don't need it anymore.
				That way you won't see any unreplaced short tags in your posts.
